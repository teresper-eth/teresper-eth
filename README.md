### 🌟 About Me

I’m not just a developer — I’m a **creator of decentralized experiences**.

With roots in systems architecture and a passion for meaningful innovation, I sculpt secure, performant blockchain ecosystems where trustlessness meets elegance.  
As a former dev at **Akido Labs**, I’ve built in fast-paced environments. Now, I dedicate my energy to **crafting systems** that balance rigor with aesthetic — **code as art**, security as harmony.

Whether I’m designing smart contracts, advising on token economies, or defining the backbone of DAOs, my approach is always the same: precise, expressive, and human-focused.

### 🧪 Core Philosophy

> "Security is structure. Strategy is composition. Web3 is our canvas."

I believe in the power of elegant cryptography, expressive code, and architectural beauty that inspires confidence and creativity.
